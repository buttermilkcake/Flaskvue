# Flaskvue
A full-stack single page application using Vue and Flask
I followed a tutorial at https://codeburst.io/full-stack-single-page-application-with-vue-js-and-flask-b1e036315532 to see if I could create a full-stack single page web app, and the answer is yes! I'm now going to work on making it mine - inserting a random song generator that will display a song title and key to play it in on each click at the front end of the website. The purpose of this exercise is to help me practice a wider variety of songs on the bass guitar and this takes the guess work out of figuring out what key the song is in.
