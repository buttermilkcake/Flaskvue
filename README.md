# Flaskvue
A full-stack single page application using Vue and Flask
I followed a tutorial at https://codeburst.io/full-stack-single-page-application-with-vue-js-and-flask-b1e036315532 to do this. I wanted to learn how to do full-stack applications and javascript. As of 6/4/18 I was able to deploy this SPWA to Herokou, but am working through bugs to get it to run in development. See my file 'how to deploy with heroku...' file for a more detailed saga on this. It works in my local environment and part of it works on heroku now.
